# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project creates a grid of square divs in the browser that act as "pixels." When a square is moused over, its darkness gradually increases until it becomes completely black. The user can also specify the number of squares per side of the grid, ranging from 1 to 100.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Mouse over any square in the grid to gradually darken it.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Use the provided button to input the number of squares per side, from 1 to 100.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the page.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file that styles the grid and other elements on the page.
- `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file that controls the grid's interactivity.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Project**: Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. **Specify Grid Size**: Click the button at the top of the page to enter the number of squares per side.
3. **Start Drawing**: Move your mouse over the grid squares to darken them. Each time you hover over a square, its color becomes progressively darker until it is completely black.
4. **Experiment**: Feel free to experiment with different grid sizes and see how the drawing changes!

Enjoy sketching!
